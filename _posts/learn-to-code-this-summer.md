Computer programming has emerged as a relevant form of storytelling. Data-driven, interactive Web and mobile projects allow users to interact with and customize story presentations, using tools like charts, quizzes, calculators and maps. In this course, students will be introduced to programming and data concepts relevant to communicators. We’ll explore current projects that demonstrate interactive characteristics and become familiar with the major organizations responsible for developing them. Students will advance their skills with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) and move into coding techniques with JavaScript and front-end framworks. This immersive session will culminate with assembling these skills into a comprehensive, interactive story.

Everyone in the class is familiar with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React and Angular from the intro Web Design course. About most of the class has some programming experience. Experienced students will be expected to implement advanced features in all their projects.

This course is designed to incorporate learning and practice time in four hour sessions each day. We hope the extra time will result in better projects and more advanced application of skill.
