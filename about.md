The Code School is an Ottawa-based, in-person coding school that guides people from all backgrounds to change their lives through career-focused education. We shape passionate coders with immersive training to meet industry needs and improve diversity in the tech scene.

In every course, students get hands-on development experience, working in teams to apply their training and building apps that expand their skills. Advanced-level students specialize in full-stack JavaScript, Python, or Java development, and contribute to the culture and goals of the companies they join.
